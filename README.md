Page Replace Simulator is an interactive web-based tool that visually demonstrates how different page replacement algorithms work in operating systems. Developed as part of a course project at Towson University, this simulator helps students and educators better understand how memory is managed through algorithms like:

FIFO (First-In, First-Out)
LRU (Least Recently Used)
Optimal Page Replacement
Users can input custom page reference strings, set frame sizes, and step through each algorithm to see how pages are loaded and replaced. The tool also provides helpful statistics such as page faults, making it a great learning resource for those studying memory management.

Features:
Interactive algorithm visualization
Customizable input (page strings and frame size)
Step-by-step simulation
Page fault statistics
